The first line of the file should be the xml declaration.
If you don't declare a character encoding, UTF-8 is the default.

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

UTF-8 is recommended, but if you are using a different character set,
you should label it correctly, or you will get encoding errors on 
upload and validation or from webapp display.  

If you are cutting and pasting from MS-Word on Windows, you may be 
using the default Windows character set. If you see encoding errors,
you might try this declaration instead:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="windows-1252"?>

[ Note: some maintenance scripts and stylesheets may convert the  
  encoding on uploaded files back to the default UTF-8. ] 
  

You should no longer include the  <?xml-stylesheet ?>  processing instruction. 
( The old stylesheets no longer work on the new files, and the new XSLT 2.0
  stylesheets are not supported by web browsers. ) 


You should include the <?xml-model ?> processing instruction below:

<?xml-model href="http://text.lib.virginia.edu/dtd/eadVIVA/ead-ext.rng"
		type="application/xml" 
		schematypens="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0" 
		title="extended EAD relaxng schema" ?>

href="http://text.lib.virginia.edu/dtd/eadVIVA/ead-ext.rng" 
is the RELAXNG schema that we use for validation of uploaded files. 
It is an extension of the standard EAD RELAXNG schema to allow
the xsi:schemaLocation attribute, so that files written to conform
to the W3C schema will also validate, and allow xml:base attributes,
which may sometimes be added by XInclude expansion. 

You may use the standard EAD schemas from the Library of Congress site
( http://www.loc.gov/ead/ead.rng or http://www.loc.gov/ead/ead.xsd  )
or you may use a local copy. You can also have multiple xml-model
processing instructions with alternative schemas. The interpretation
of multiple xml-model statements is not defined. Currently, the 
Oxygen XML editor will attempt to validate against all of the listed
schemas. 


Do not include a  "<!DOCTYPE " statement or an internal DTD subset. 

We no longer use entity references for external URLs. 
Use xlink hrefs instead. 

We no longer use external parsed entities for boilerplate inclusions.
Use XInclude instead. 




Declare the default namespace declaration in the root <ead> element.
You should also declare the xlink namespace in the root element: 
it saves you from having to repeatedly declare it locally in the
elements that include xlinks. 
You may also declare the XInclude namespace in the root element. 

<ead xmlns="urn:isbn:1-931666-22-9" 
	xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" 
	xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude" id="^%eadid%">
	

In /ead/eadheader/eadid: 

The value of @countrycode attributes should be capitalized:
    countrycode="US"
@mainagencycodes should also be prefixed with the countrycode and a hyphen:
	mainagencycode="US-ViU"
If you use the @repositorycode in the eadheader, it should also be prefixed
with the countrycode. 

Note: New institutions can look up there agencycodes here:
	http://www.loc.gov/marc/organizations/org-search.php?submit=Search&stateID=48 


Instead of following /ead/eadheader/filedesc/publicationstmt/publisher
with the &address; external entity reference, use an xinclude statement:

<xi:include xmlns:xi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XInclude"  
href="http://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaead/add_con/uva-sc_address.xi.xml" />

Change the href to point to the xinclude file for your institution. 
Versions of the include files with namespace declarations 

or else include the <address> block inline. 



We are no longer using the contact information in the <frontmatter> 
following /ead/frontmatter/titlepage/publisher in the display. 
But whether you include this information or not, you should not
be using either the &address; or &contact; external entities. 
If you with to include this information, you can use XInclude
( href="http://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaead/add_con/inst_contact.xi.xml" ) 
as above, or include the information inline. 

The previous Best Practice Guide suggested including sponsor information
in a paragraph following the contact info in the <frontmatter><titlepage>. 
Since we are no longer using that info in the display, you should instead
use a <sponsor> element within /ead/eadheader/filedesc/titlestmt. 

The institution logo is one element from the <frontmatter><titlepage>
we are still using in the display. However, as noted above, we are no
longer using external entities. 

The logo statement should be changed to an <extprt> with xlink attributes:

<p id="logostmt">
<extptr xlink:actuate="onLoad" xlink:show="embed" xlink:type="simple" 
	xlink:href="http://ead.lib.virginia.edu/vivaead/logos/uva-sc.jpg"/>
<!-- Change to match your institution -->


Linking Attributes: 
 All other @entityref attributes, in <dao>, <extptr> or any other elements
should be changed to xlink:href attributes, and the xlink namespace should
be declared locally if it has not already been declared in the top root element. 


The following attributes in the <extpr> or <dao> elements must have the "xlink:" prepended to them:

	actuate
	arcrole
	from
	href 
	label
	
	linktype  should be changed to xlink:type="value" 
	most of the time, the value should be "simple" 
	


Dates:

Normal attributes in date fields can no longer be 6 digits - 
they must be of one of these formats:
	yyyymmdd
	yyyy
	yyyymmdd/yyyymmdd
	yyyy/yyyy
The "day" portion cannot be "00". I.e., 20090200 is not valid but 20090201 is.
