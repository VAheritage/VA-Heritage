The first line of the file should be the xml declaration.
If you don't declare a character encoding, UTF-8 is the default.

<?xml version="1.0" ?>
<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>

UTF-8 is recommended, but if you are using a different character set,
you should label it correctly, or you will get encoding errors on 
upload and validation or from webapp display.  

If you are cutting and pasting from MS-Word on Windows, you may be 
using the default Windows character set. If you see encoding errors,
you might try this declaration instead:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="windows-1252"?>

[ Note: some maintenance scripts and stylesheets may convert the  
  encoding on uploaded files back to the default UTF-8. ] 
  

You should no longer include the  <?xml-stylesheet ?>  processing instruction. 
( The old stylesheets no longer work on the new files, and the new XSLT 2.0
  stylesheets are not supported by web browsers. ) 


You should include the <?xml-model ?> processing instruction below:

<?xml-model href="http://text.lib.virginia.edu/dtd/eadVIVA/ead-ext.rng"
		type="application/xml" 
		schematypens="http://relaxng.org/ns/structure/1.0" 
		title="extended EAD relaxng schema" ?>
